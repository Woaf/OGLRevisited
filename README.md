# OGLRevisited
A project for the revisited OpenGL course. 

## The old project 
About half a year ago, I finished an OpenGL course on Udemy, which was really thorough, however it was a bit hard for me to follow. 
Hence, I decided to approach learning OpenGL from another site (learnopengl.com), which turned out to be more easy to understand. 

## The new projeect (this)
This project stores all the code that I put together following the tutorials on learnopengl.com. 
Luckily, I can finally say that I have an indepth knowlegde about everything in this codebase.
